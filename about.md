How I did start Programming?

From an early age, I was so interested in building a web site.I had built my web page with Photoshop and HTML as a hobby when I was a kid. It was possible to create simple web pages at that time without knowing programming languages. One day, my mother's friend asked me to build a web site for her pet shop, so I built a simple web shopping mall using CMS. When I was looking for my first job, I put this in my resume as my experience and I was able to get a job as a web designer in the marketing agency. After I moved to another workplace, I saw the developer team in the company. It seems very nice, touched my desire to learn it. I didn't hesitate to start learning new and entered the Seneca College for my new career.
